# BOO
Best Openings Overall

These opening's are from Hikaru and Levy's (beginner,intermediate,grandmaster) tier list videos.

There's no tiers here, just placement on the list matters. Therefore lower score is better.
So if you play opening that has low score on all 3, technically you could play it against all skill level's.

Average score is just sum divided by the number of appearances (videos).
Don't take this too seriously but i hope it helps newcomers like myself, or even skilled players.
