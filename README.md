Best Overall Openings

These opening's are from Hikaru and Levy's (beginner, intermediate & grandmaster) tier list videos.

There's no tiers here, just placement on the list matters. Therefore lower score is better. Score is sum of all placings and average is score divided by number of videos the opening is featured in.
So if you play opening that has low score on all 3, technically you could play it against all skill level's.

### asc folder has everything in detail!
Simple lists can be found in txt folder.

Don't take this too seriously but i hope it helps newcomers like myself, or even skilled players.
